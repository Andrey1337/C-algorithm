C-Algorithm 
	This is the main application source file.
	
		function Main this is the main fucntion, function receives graph values as a _parametr_. Then function calls to Dijkstra function.

		function Dijkstra puts the maximum values in array of marks, and then in all nodes function check the shortest way to another node.

		fucntion MinDistance checks the shortest way by marks in other nodes in array.
